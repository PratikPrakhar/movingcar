Will there be a Hacktoberfest 2022
Expand your open source contributions during Hacktoberfest 2022. Give back to open source projects during the month of October! This year, we're encouraging more than code contributions: writing, design, advocacy, and financial donations. Hacktoberfest is back for its ninth year!
